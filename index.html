			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am an actuarial science major at Brigham Young University. I have a lot of hobbies that include computers, basketball, cars, and reading. Really I just like having a good time with good people. I feel as if I need to fill this space too, so I will keep listing details about me. I grew up in Weston, ID. As you expect of the rural Idaho kid, I grew up on a farm and went to the smallest school you can imagine. I played on the basketball team, but we never won State. We lost in the State Championship game my Junior year. I built the computer that I am currently doing this on, and I really need to replace the fans because I messed the one up so it's making a ton of noise right now. I think I have filled up enough of this now so that is all you get to know about me.</p>
